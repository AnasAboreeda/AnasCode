### AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. EC2 supports a variety of operating systems, including Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, MacOS, and more, giving you full control at the operating system layer.

#### Instance Limits

By default, you are limited to:

- Running up to 20 On-Demand instances across the instance family.
- Purchasing 20 Reserved Instances.
- Requesting Spot Instances per your dynamic spot limit per region.

#### EC2 Compute Units (ECU)

ECUs provide a relative measure of an Amazon EC2 instance's integer processing power.

#### Key Pairs

Key pairs are used to securely connect to EC2 instances. A key pair consists of:

- A public key stored by AWS.
- A private key file stored by you.

For Windows AMIs, the private key file is required to obtain the password used to log into your instance. For Linux AMIs, it allows you to securely SSH into your instance.

#### Metadata and User Data

- **User Data**: Supplied at instance launch in the form of a script, limited to 16KB and not encrypted.
- **Instance Metadata**: Available at `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`, used to configure or manage the running instance. The IP address `169.254.169.254` is a link-local address valid only from the instance.

### Billing and Provisioning

#### On-Demand Instances

- Pay for hours used with no commitment.
- Ideal for Auto Scaling groups and unpredictable workloads.
- Good for development and testing.

#### Spot Instances

- Take advantage of unused EC2 capacity at up to 90% discount compared to on-demand prices.
- Ideal for stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications.
- Receive a two-minute interruption notice before being reclaimed by EC2.
- Diversify across multiple capacity pools to reduce the impact of interruptions.

#### Reserved Instances (RIs)

- **Standard**: 1 or 3-year commitment, charged whether the instance is on or off.
- **Convertible**: Can change the attributes of the RI, given the resulting RI is equal or greater in value.
- **Scheduled**: Reserved for specific periods; accrue charges hourly, billed monthly over the term (1 year).

RIs are ideal for steady-state workloads and predictable usage. Upfront payments reduce the hourly rate. They can be used in Auto Scaling Groups and Placement Groups.

**Instance Type Modifications**: Supported for Linux only. Windows RIs cannot change the instance size.

**Sharing RIs**: Can be shared across multiple accounts within Consolidated Billing. If not needed, RIs can be sold on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

**RI Attributes**:

- **Instance Type**: CPU, memory, and networking capability.
- **Platform**: Linux, SUSE Linux, RHEL, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft SQL Server.
- **Tenancy**: Default (shared) or Dedicated.
- **Availability Zone (optional)**: Zonal RI offers a discount and reservation in a specific AZ. Regional RI applies a discount to any instance in the family in any AZ in the region without reservation.

### Dedicated Hosts

Dedicated hosts are physical servers dedicated just for your use, giving you control over which instances are deployed on that host. Available as On-Demand or with Dedicated Host Reservation, they are useful if you have server-bound software licenses that use metrics like per-core, per-socket, or per-VM. Each dedicated host can only run one EC2 instance size and type, ensuring predictable performance and complete isolation.

**Billing**:

- Most expensive option.
- Billing is per host.

### Dedicated Instances

Dedicated instances are virtualized instances on hardware just for you, using physically dedicated EC2 servers. However, they do not provide the additional visibility and controls of dedicated hosts (e.g., how instances are placed on a server). Available as On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances, they may share hardware with other non-dedicated instances in the same account.

**Billing**:

- Costs an additional $2 per hour per region.
- Billing is per host.

#### Instance Naming Convention

### Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

- An AMI includes the operating system, storage mapping, architecture type, launch permissions, and any additional preinstalled software applications.
- EC2 instances are live instantiations (or versions) of what is defined in an AMI, as a cake is a live instantiation of a cake recipe.

### AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- **Amazon ECS Overview:** Amazon ECS is a container orchestration service for deploying and managing containers.
- **Task Definitions:** Define containers in a JSON task definition for individual tasks or tasks within a service.
- **Deployment Options:** Run tasks on serverless AWS Fargate or manage infrastructure with EC2 instances.
- **Container Instances:** EC2 instances with the ECS agent installed, communicating with ECS for cluster management.
- **Functionality:** Includes launching/stopping containers, scaling, scheduling, and assigning permissions.

> A container is more lightweight than VM. Containers spin up quicker, almost instantly. This difference in startup time becomes instrumental when designing applications that must scale quickly during I/O bursts.

For more details, visit the [AWS ECS page](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vZjPkMIhS71-rp32OtiRLw.png)

#### Running an App on ECS

To prepare your application to run on Amazon ECS, you create a task definition.

```json
{
 "family": "webserver",
 "containerDefinitions": [ {
    "name": "web",
    "image": "nginx",
    "memory": "100",
    "cpu": "99"
 } ],
 "requiresCompatibilities": [ "FARGATE" ],
 "networkMode": "awsvpc",
 "memory": "512",
 "cpu": "256"
}
```

#### ECS Service Scheduler

Amazon ECS provides a service scheduler (for long-running tasks and applications), **the ability to run tasks manually (for batch jobs or single run tasks),** with Amazon ECS placing tasks on your cluster for you.

You can specify task placement strategies and constraints that allow you to run tasks in the configuration you choose, such as spread out across Availability Zones. It is also possible to integrate with custom or third-party schedulers.

#### Auto-scaling

Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling supports both **step scaling policies** and **target tracking scaling policies**, but *AWS recommends using target tracking scaling policies*.

- **Target Tracking Scaling Policies:** Automatically adjust scaling based on metrics like CPU utilization. Ideal for standard use cases.
- **Step Scaling Policies:** Require manual creation and management of CloudWatch alarms for scaling actions. Suitable if target tracking alarms are insufficient.
- **Combined Use:** Both policies can be used together for advanced configurations, allowing for more aggressive scaling responses.

**Key Points:**

- Target tracking is generally preferred for its intelligence in adjusting scaling based on needs.
- Step scaling offers granular control with multiple threshold ranges.
- Combination of both can provide advanced and aggressive scaling strategies.

### Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

- **Amazon EKS Overview:** Amazon EKS is a managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS without managing the control plane or nodes.
- **Benefits:** Amazon EKS provides simplicity, high availability, and fine-grained control for managing Kubernetes workloads on AWS.

#### Differences from ECS:

- In ECS, containers run on EC2 instances with ECS agents (container instances).
- In EKS, containers run on Kubernetes worker nodes.
     ECS containers are called tasks; EKS containers are called pods.
- ECS uses AWS native technology; EKS uses Kubernetes.

For more details, visit the [Amazon EKS page.](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
